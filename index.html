      <div class="about-me-content">
        <p>My name is Tiegan Archer and I am a graphic design student. I am also a singer/songwriter (EP coming soon?), a guitar and ukulele teacher, a hobby-level crocheter and embroiderer, an avid watcher of dungeons & dragons actual-play shows, and a cash supervisor (recently promoted) at a grocery store. I collect merchandise branded as my favourite Star Wars character, Ahsoka Tano, as well as soft, squishable, and stupid-looking stuffed animals. I have a tattoo of a guitar with a crescent moon shaped body and some stars and clouds and can usually be seen wearing dangly planet and moon earrings. My phone case has a vintage constellation map design and my laptop is plastered with solar system stickers. I like to think of the night sky as my brand. I even crocheted a cute star-moon-cloud dangly ornament for the rear-view mirror in my car.</p>
